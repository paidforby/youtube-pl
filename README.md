# youtube-pl
tired of rewriting this shell script that utilizes youtube-dl to organize your locally cached music directories.

be sure to install and/or update youtube-dl before running this. To get latest version of youtube-dl, it is best to use pip.  

```
sudo apt install python3-pip ffmpeg
sudo pip3 install youtube-dl
```
If the script stops working its probably because youtube-dl needs to be updated (this is required very frequently), to update,
```
pip3 install -U youtube-dl
```
