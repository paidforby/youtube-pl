# youtube-pl
tired of rewriting this shell script that utilizes youtube-dl to organize your locally cached music directories.

be sure to install and/or update youtube-dl before running this. To get latest version of youtube-dl, it is best to use pip.  

```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install youtube-dl
youtube-dl -U
```
